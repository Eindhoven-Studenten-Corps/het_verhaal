# Het verhaal
De verhuizing van ESC

Made using: https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/index.html

Initially made using a spreadsheet, but it was lost over time.

Now made using JSON format: https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/json-format.html

The data is stored in a gist on this Github account

The images are loaded from the GitHub repository (raw)

So when updating it is important to:
- Update the gist
- Copy the raw gist link (!!! RAW !!!)
- Update the gist link in het_verhaal.html for housekeeping
- Update the gist link in congressus on the page which includes the timeline, which results in the actual changes on site

If you want you could try to store the images and the data.json in Congressus directly and find out how file reference system works but I am not going to bother.
